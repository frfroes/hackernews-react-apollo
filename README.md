# hackernews-react-apollo

A sample project written in React that aims to implement a hackernews frontend replica using Apollo to fetch from a GraphQL API.

This project is fully based on the GraphQL Node [tutorial](https://www.howtographql.com/react-apollo/0-introduction/) written by [Nikolas Burk](https://twitter.com/nikolasburk) for the [howtographql.com](https://www.howtographql.com/).

You can check out the final result [**here**](https://hackernews-frfroes.herokuapp.com/) or download to your local machine and setting up manually.

## Manual Setup
Just clone the repo to your local machine, go to the root folder  and install the local dependencies with `npm install` then run `npm start` and you are good to go.
